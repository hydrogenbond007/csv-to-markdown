# csv-to-markdown
Lol the code is super simple, was working on converting the csv data to make it more visal with building roam research type knolwdge graphs so wrote this and worked pretty well.
just copy the code in any jupyter notebook and it should work fine.

make sure to install pip packages 
### pip install csv && pandas
